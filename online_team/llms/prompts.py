In this task, you are presented with a user query and an academic paper with snippets and metadata.

Stitch together text from the paper content to directly answer the question. 

To be clear, copy EXACT text ONLY.

Include any references that are part of the text to be copied. The references can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of the text.

eg, if you chose to include the text "(Moe et al., 2020) show that A is very important for B (Miles, 2023) and this has been known since 2024 [1][2]", 
it's critical that all the references (Moe et al., 2020), (Miles, 2023), [1] and [2] are part of the extracted quote. Include all forms of academic citation if they are contiguous with your selected quote.

Use ... to indicate that there is a gap of excluded text between text you chose.

For example: Text to answer... More text here... start a sentence in the middle.

No need to use the title. 

Sometimes you will see authors and/or section titles. Do not use them in your answer.

Output the quote ONLY. Do not introduce it with any text, formatting, or white spaces.

If the paper does not answer the user query at all, just output None

Synthesis paragraphs are right when the user wants a coherent explanation or comparison or analysis or singular answer.

For user queries that are simpler, you only need one dimension.

SYSTEM_PROMPT_QUOTE_CLUSTER = f"""
In this task, you are presented with quoted passages that were collected from a set of papers.
The goal is to fuse all those quotes into a summary answer/report that satisfies the user query in an easy-to-consume format.

As an intermediate step, please cluster quotes for different section in the summary. 
First, output a set of DIMENSIONS that break down the user query for a scientific audience. 

{CLUSTER_PROMPT_FEW_SHOTS}

You should start by making a plan of which candidate dimensions make sense to clearly and directly answer the query, ignoring the snippets.

The first section should be title "Introduction" or "Background" to provide the user the key basics needed to understand the rest of the answer.

{CLUSTER_PROMPT_DIRECTIVE}

IMPORTANT: Make sure the clusters are in the same order you would then write the corresponding summary.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that EVERY input quote is included somewhere in the output.
IMPORTANT: Some sections may not have any quotes to support them. Include them in the output JSON regardless with an empty list. This is particularly true of the "Introduction" or "Background" section.

Choose list or synthesis with deep care and wisdom. Start with a markdown justification for the section name and its format.

The last thing you output is an assignment of each quote to a dimension like so:  
{{
"cot": "Justification for every dimension name and its format...",
"dimensions": [{{"name": "dimension name 1", "format": "synthesis or list", "quotes": [comma-delimited highlights indices]}},
{{"name": "dimension name 2", "format": "synthesis or list", "quotes": [comma-delimited highlights indices]}},
{{"name": "dimension name 3", "format": "synthesis or list", "quotes": []}},  # empty because we didn't find any supporting quotes
...

A user issued a query and a set of papers were provided with salient content.
The user query was: {query}

Here is the overall plan for the summary answer:

<plan>
{plan}
</plan>

I will provide you with the name of one section from the plan at a time, along with the list of chosen quotes for that section. 
Your job is to help me write this section and cite the provided quoted references. 

Here is what has already been written:
<already_written_sections>
{already_written}
</already_written_sections>

The section I would like you to write next is (type of section):
<section_name>
{section_name}
</section_name>

Here are the reference quotes to cite for this section:
<section_references>
{section_references}
</section_references>

<citation instructions>
- Each reference is a key value pair, where the key is a pipe separated string enclosed in square brackets representing [ID | AUTHOR_REF | YEAR | Citations: CITES].

The value consists of the quote and sometimes a dictionary of inline citations referenced in that quote
eg. "[2345677 | Doe, Moe et al. | 2024 | Citations: 25]": {{"quote": "This is the reference text.", "inline citations": {{"[4517277 | Hero et al. | 2019 | Citations: 250]": "This is an inline citation."}}}}

- Please write this section, making sure to cite the relevant references inline using the corresponding reference key in the format: [ID | AUTHOR_REF | YEAR | Citations: CITES]. You may use more than one reference key in a row if it's appropriate. In general, use all of the references that support your written text.

- Along with the quote, if any of its accompanying inline citations are relevant to or mentioned in the claim you are writing, you should cite them too using the same aforementioned format. 

For example, let's say you write 

"The X was shown to be Y." [1234 | A | 2023 | Citations: 3]. 

And the reference A (2023) you want to cite states "As shown in B (2020), X is Y." In this case, reference 1234 is textually direct support for what you wrote, but it itself clearly states that B (2020) is the actual source of this information. As such, you need to cite both, one after the other as 

"The X was shown to be Y." [1234 | A | 2023 | Citations: 3] [4321 | B | 202 | Citations: 25]

- You can add something from your own knowledge. This should only be done if you are sure about its truth and/or if there is not enough information in the references to answer the user's question. Cite the text from your knowledge as [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. The citation should follow AFTER the text. Don't cite LLM Memory with another evidence source. 

- Note that all citations that support what you write must come after the test you write. That's how humans read in-line cited text. First text, then the citation.
</citation instructions>

<writing instructions>
The section should have the following characteristics:
- Before the section write a 2 sentence "TLDR;" of the section. No citations here. Precede with the text "TLDR;"
- Use direct and simple language everywhere, like "use" and "can". Avoid using more complex words if simple ones will do.
- Use the citation count to decide what is "notable" or "important". If the citation count is 100 or more, you are allowed to use value judgments like "notable."
- Some references are older. Something that claims to be "state of the art" but is from 2020 may not be any more. Please avoid making such claims.
- Be concise.
- The section you write must be a coherent continuation of already_written and directly answer the user query.
- The section you write should add to the user's understanding of what they learned in already_written. 
- Multiple references may express the same idea. If so, you can cite multiple references in a single sentence.
- Do not make the same points that were made in the previous already written sections.
</writing instructions>

<format and structure instructions>
Start the section with its section_name and then a newline and then the text "TLDR;", the actual TLDR, and then write the summary. 
Rules for section formatting:
- For example, if the section name in the plan is "Important Papers (list)", then write it as "Important Papers" and format the section as a LIST (required). 
- For example, if the section name in the plan is "Deep Dive on Networks (synthesis)" then render it as "Deep Dive on Networks" and write a SYNTHESIS paragraph (required).
- The section format MUST match what's in the parentheses of the section name. A list HAS to be a list. a SYNTHESIS has to be a paragraph. Seriously.
- Write the section content using markdown format

<task>
Your task is to analyze a query issued by a user of an academic question-answering system and produce a structured JSON output for search.  

Only extract and output the following components:
1. earliest_search_year: If the query specifies a time range (e.g., “recent” or “last five years”), convert it to the relevant year. If no time range is mentioned, leave it blank. The current year is 2025. Interpret “recent” as 2022–2025 and adjust other relative terms accordingly.
2. latest_search_year: Similar to earliest_search_year.
3. authors: List any authors explicitly mentioned in the query. Each author should appear as a separate entry in an array. Leave empty if none.
4. rewritten_query: Simplify the query into a concise, natural-language phrase, excluding information already extracted into years or authors.
5. rewritten_query_for_keyword_search: Remove unnecessary stop words and connectors to create a keyword-friendly version of the remaining query, excluding information already extracted.

If any field cannot be inferred, leave it empty.
